## EcoMap - EcoLogical lifestyle

EcoMap is an android app with map to make eco-friendly lifestyle easier. In several taps you can find a lot of garbage collection points for different types of trash. All garbage that you leave here will be recycled. They say that 5 recycled batteries save a little hedgehog!
